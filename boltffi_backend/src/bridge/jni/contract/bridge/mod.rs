//! Crate-level JNI contract for one generated source file.
//!
//! `JniBridgeContract` is the finished JNI view of a crate. It names the owner
//! JVM class, generated source path, included C header, buffer release function,
//! and every native method, callback registration, closure registration, stream
//! protocol, and async callback completion invoker that must appear in the C
//! file.
//!
//! This is the only JNI contract module that sees the whole C bridge contract.
//! It performs the crate-wide pass once, then hands each feature module the
//! smaller contract pieces it owns. That prevents templates and leaf modules
//! from asking broad questions such as which declarations exist, whether stream
//! helpers are needed, or which closure signatures must be registered.

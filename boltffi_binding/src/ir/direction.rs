//! Type-level markers for boundary direction and callable scope.
//!
//! A boundary crossing has a direction. The parameter and return plans
//! ([`ParamPlan`], [`ReturnPlan`]) take a [`Direction`] type parameter and
//! describe one value crossing in that direction. A callable has a
//! scope. [`CallableDecl`] takes a [`CallableScope`] type parameter,
//! and the scope's `ParamDirection` and `ReturnDirection` fix the
//! directions of the params, the return, and the error channel.
//!
//! [`ParamPlan`]: crate::ParamPlan
//! [`ReturnPlan`]: crate::ReturnPlan
//! [`CallableDecl`]: crate::CallableDecl
